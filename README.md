# HuntersHelper
In classic WoW, some hunter pet spells need to be learned by taming wild beasts. This addon will help you find which beast you need to tame to learn the spell you want.

This is a continuation of an [addon](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4072-FizzwidgetHuntersHelper.html) made by Gazmik Fizzwidget. The original addon was abandoned when WoW updates removed the need for it, but WoW Classic has returned the need for it.  

Features:

* When you mouse over a beast in the world, the tooltip will show which abilities a Hunter could learn after taming it. (Or no additional info if the beast doesn't have any known abilities.)
 

* If you're currently playing a hunter, the abilities will be colored according to whether you've already learned them: green for abilities you have yet to learn, and gray for those you already know.
Need to know where to find new abilities for your pet?
 

* Type `/huntershelper` (or `/hh`) to show the Hunter's Helper UI and browse its database by ability or by zone. Various filters and a search feature are available, so it's quick to find a pet that has what you're looking for.

* Visit the Hunter's Helper pane in the Interface Options window (or type `/hh button`) to enable the HH minimap button, which shows when you're in a zone that contains beasts you can tame to learn new abilities. (Mouse over it for details on them.)
* Type `/hh find <ability> <rank>` for a quick search with results in the chat window.
* The Hunter's Helper UI also serves as an improved replacement for the Beast Training window; its compact layout and flexible filters make finding an ability and rank much quicker... and it shows accurate training point costs for upgrading an ability to a higher rank. (Tip: this means you can also show the HH UI by "casting" Beast Training from your spellbook, action bar, or macro.)
